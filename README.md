# Bacteria density

- This Python script allows to create a 1D representation of the density of bacteria according to the distance within a tubular organ.
- It creates a skeletonized version of the organ based on the DAPI channel and performs measures in the other channel.
- The results can be exported "raw" or "binned" (with bins of a fixed length).
